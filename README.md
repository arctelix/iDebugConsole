# iDebugConsole

A compact javscript console wrapper with a debug switch and a compact output window that won't 
slow you down.  Also includes a handy site profileing decorator.

The primary purpose is to provide a means for controlling console output globally and within 
closures as required.  An optional output window is provided as well.  This is helpful for 
devices without a console window or when you do not require the full feature set of the native
browser consoles.  Finally a handy profiler for profiling javascript code execution and individual 
components.

All that utility at just 0.309kb minified in a production environment and under 12kb minified 
in development.

#### Requirements:
